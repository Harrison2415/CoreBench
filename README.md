# CoreBench

Hi! 😄 I decided to compare the performance of different microcontroller cores as a way to learn 📚, gain some knowledge 🧠, and have a bit of fun along the way 🎮. 

For that, I picked **QuickSort** — it seemed light enough to run on microcontrollers ⚙️, but heavy enough to make them sweat a little 💦😂.

So far, due to a low budget 💸 (lol), I’m comparing just two chips: an **ESP32** and an **ESP32-S3** with 16MB.  
I'm running a single-core version of the code first, gradually increasing the number of elements until the limit 📈.  
Then, I run the same test using all available cores on the S3 🔥.

> **Spoiler alert**: the performance difference is very noticeable, and it was super fun to see it in action 🤓⚡!

Stay tuned for updates as I explore more chips and challenges! 🛠️🚀
